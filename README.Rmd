# About 

_R posts you might have missed!_ and _Python posts you might have missed!_ are semi-automated twitter accounts posting recent data science related content. The goal is to make it easier to keep up with the most important packages and news from the community. Links to relevant and popular resources are gathered from twitter and the wider data science blogosphere before being processed and lightly curated.  For more information about how the feed works and why it came into being, please check out [this blog post](https://alastairrushworth.github.io/R-Posts-You-Might-Have-Missed!/).
